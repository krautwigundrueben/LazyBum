# LazyBum

_LazyBum_ is a highly customized home automation app that can serve as an inspiration and / or starting point for your own app. It integrates different kinds of home automation devices from brands, such as [Shelly](<https://shelly.cloud>) and [MyStrom](<https://mystrom.com>) and my own Arduino. The Arduino offers an API, which lets the app control peripherals like an AV Receiver (via UDP over Ethernet) and a Sky TV Receiver (via infrared LED).

## Tabs
