# LazyBum

_LazyBum_ is a highly customized home automation app that can serve as an inspiration and / or starting point for your own app. It integrates different kinds of home automation devices from brands, such as [Shelly](<https://shelly.cloud>) and [MyStrom](<https://mystrom.com>) and my own Arduino. The Arduino offers an API, which lets the app control peripherals like an AV Receiver (via UDP over Ethernet) and a Sky TV Receiver (via IR LED).

## Tabs

- 📦 **modular devices** can be switched on and off - some devices offer more features on an alert dialog on long press
- 🌅 **scenes** (WIP) can control several devices at once
- 📺 **av receiver** for controlling the receiver's source and volume
- 🏠 **rollers** alternates between up, stop and down
